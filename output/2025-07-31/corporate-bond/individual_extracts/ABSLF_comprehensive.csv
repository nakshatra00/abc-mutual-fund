,,other_security,,This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is linked to the interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged with derivatives is likely to be lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration. Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate due diligence when deciding to make their investments.,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,2025-07-31
